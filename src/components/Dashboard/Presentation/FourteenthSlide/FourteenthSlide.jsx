            LEVEL-UP is the activation of the next more expensive level, the income of which is 2 times more than the previous level. The principle of all levels is the same. Level-up can be carried out only sequentially, starting from the first level. For example, you cannot activate level 5 if you have not activated level 4.
            Keep in mind that if your junior partner activates some level before you, you will miss the reward. In this case, it will go to your superior partners.

        <h3>
            How many levels to activate?
        </h3>
        <p>
            It's up to you how many levels you activate at the start, just one or all of them. However, based on experience and math, we recommend starting with at least 3-4 levels to get a better start and avoid the missing profit. This is the most balanced approach to building your structure quickly and efficiently. You can activate any number of levels at once, and you can buy the next levels with the profits of the previous ones, but do not forget to monitor the activation of your referrals to avoid the missing profit.
