                Our project is a web 3.0 platform
            </h3>
            <p>
                that combines blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts technologies while allowing community members to make money easily and interestingly and to learn about how works the web 3.0.

                How does the smart contract mechanism that makes Infinity Space work?
            </h3>
            <p>
                As we mentioned before, a smart contract contains an algorithm that was written to execute, and once published on the blockchain, the algorithm cannot be changed. A smart contract manages all the processes within the platform without the need or possibility of external intervention.
