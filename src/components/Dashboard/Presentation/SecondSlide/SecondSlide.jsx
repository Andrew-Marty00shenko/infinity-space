        <p>
            The Infinity Space platform and community were created by enthusiasts consumed by the idea of a speedy implementation and full integration of Web 3.0 into the Internet space. The creators are convinced that Web 3.0 is the future knocking on our doors and will inevitably come into every home, just as the Internet. And whoever takes the initiative to explore web 3.0 now will be a few steps ahead of everyone else in the future.
            <br /><br />
            Yes, in our project, you will make money in a non-trivial way. But its main purpose is to attract as many users as possible for a pleasant and useful interaction and acquaintance with Web 3.0 in the form of a game.
