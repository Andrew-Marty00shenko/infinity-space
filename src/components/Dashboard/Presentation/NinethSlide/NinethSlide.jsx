            So what happens after you sign up? BUSD from your MetaMask wallet is transferred to a smart contract and according to the algorithm is redistributed among the wallets of other Infinity Space community members. The person who invited you - the upliner - gets 60% of the value of the level you bought. Their upliner gets 30% and that personâ€™s upliner gets 10%.

            Infinity Space Marketing works based on smart contracts technology in the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. All transactions are conducted in BUSD tokens on the BEP-20 network and transaction fees are charged in BNB tokens.
