            As part of our project, not only are we introducing you to Web 3.0 through interaction with the platform, but we're also launching a separate section of the site â€“ the Web 3.0 Academy. In this section, you can learn new information about web 3.0, dive deeper into this wonderful world, and paint in your head a more complete picture of this new space.
